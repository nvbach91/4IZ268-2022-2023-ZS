            <h4 id="routing-basic-routing">1.1 Basic Routing</h4>
            <p>
                The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and expressive method
                of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing configuration files:
            </p>
            <pre>
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/greeting', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
            </pre>

            <h5 id="routing-redirect">1.1.1 Redirect Routes</h5>
            <p>
                If you are defining a route that redirects to another URI, you may use the <code>Route::redirect</code>
                method. This
                method provides a convenient shortcut so that you do not have to define a full route or controller for
                performing a simple redirect:
            </p>
            <pre>
Route::redirect('/here', '/there');
            </pre>
            <p>
                By default, <code>Route::redirect</code> returns a <code>302</code> status code. You may customize the
                status code using the optional third parameter:
            </p>
            <pre>
Route::redirect('/here', '/there', 301);
            </pre>
            <table>
                <caption>HTTP redirect codes and some other codes</caption>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Code</th>

                        <td>The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the

                            used by the client in future requests.

            <h5 id="routing-view">1.1.2 View Routes</h5>
            <p>
                If your route only needs to return a view, you may use the <code>Route::view</code> method. Like the
                <code>redirect</code> method,
                this method provides a simple shortcut so that you do not have to define a full route or controller. The
                <code>view</code> method accepts a URI as its first argument and a view name as its second argument. In
                addition, you
                may provide an array of data to pass to the view as an optional third argument:
            </p>
            <pre>
Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome');

Route::view('/welcome', 'welcome', ['name' => 'Taylor']);
            </pre>

            <h5 id="routing-route-list">1.1.2 The Route List</h5>
            <p>
                The <code>route:list</code> Artisan command can easily provide an overview of all of the routes that are
                defined by your application:
            </p>
            <pre>
php artisan route:list
            </pre>
