            <p>
                Many web applications provide a way for their users to authenticate with the application and "login".
                Implementing this feature in web applications can be a complex and potentially risky endeavor. For this
                reason, Laravel strives to give you the tools you need to implement authentication quickly, securely,
                and easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, Laravel's authentication facilities are made up of "guards" and "providers". Guards define
                how users are authenticated for each request. For example, Laravel ships with a session guard which
                maintains state using <code>session</code> storage and cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Providers define how users are retrieved from your persistent storage. Laravel ships with support for
                retrieving users using Eloquent and the database query builder. However, you are free to define
                additional providers as needed for your application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your application's authentication configuration file is located at config/auth.php. This file contains
                several well-documented options for tweaking the behavior of Laravel's authentication services.
            </p>

                            cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.

                            want to “move left” as an industry, it calls for more use of threat modeling, secure design
                            patterns and principles, and reference architectures.

                            see this category move up. The former category for XML External Entities (XXE) is now part
                            of this category.

                            community survey, but also had enough data to make the Top 10 via data analysis. This
                            category moves up from #9 in 2017 and is a known issue that we struggle to test and assess
                            risk. It is the only category not to have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs)
                            mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploit and impact weights of 5.0 are factored
                            into their scores.

                            integral part of the Top 10, but the increased availability of standardized frameworks seems
                            to be helping.

                            critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity. One of the highest weighted

                            (CVE/CVSS) data mapped to the 10 CWEs in this category. Insecure Deserialization from 2017
                            is now a part of this larger category.

            <h4 id="authentication-password-confirmation">1.1 Password Confirmation</h4>
            <p>
                While building your application, you may occasionally have actions that should require the user to
                confirm their password before the action is performed or before the user is redirected to a sensitive
                area of the application. Laravel includes built-in middleware to make this process a breeze.
                Implementing this feature will require you to define two routes: one route to display a view asking the
                user to confirm their password and another route to confirm that the password is valid and redirect the
                user to their intended destination.
            </p>

            <h5 id="authentication-configuration">1.1.1 Configuration</h5>
            <p>
                After confirming their password, a user will not be asked to confirm their password again for three
                hours. However, you may configure the length of time before the user is re-prompted for their password
                by changing the value of the <code>password_timeout</code> configuration value within your application's
                <code>config/auth.php</code> configuration file.
            </p>

            <h5 id="authentication-routing">1.1.2 Routing</h5>
            <p>
                First, we will define a route to display a view that requests the user to confirm their password:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../assets/img/password-confirm-route.png" alt="Password confirmation route example">
                <figcaption>
                    Password confirmation route example
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As you might expect, the view that is returned by this route should have a form containing a <code>password</code>
                field. In addition, feel free to include text within the view that explains that the user is entering a
                protected area of the application and must confirm their password.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we will define a route that will handle the form request from the "confirm password" view. This
                route will be responsible for validating the password and redirecting the user to their intended
                destination:
            </p>
            <pre>
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect;

Route::post('/confirm-password', function (Request $request) {
    if (! Hash::check($request->password, $request->user()->password)) {
        return back()->withErrors([
            'password' => ['The provided password does not match our records.']
        ]);
    }

    $request->session()->passwordConfirmed();

    return redirect()->intended();
})->middleware(['auth', 'throttle:6,1']);
            </pre>

            <h5 id="authentication-protection">1.1.3 Protecting Routes</h5>
            <p>
                You should ensure that any route that performs an action which requires recent password confirmation is
                assigned the <code>password.confirm</code> middleware. This middleware is included with the default
                installation of
                Laravel and will automatically store the user's intended destination in the session so that the user may
                be redirected to that location after confirming their password. After storing the user's intended
                destination in the session, the middleware will redirect the user to the <code>password.confirm</code>
                named route:
            </p>
