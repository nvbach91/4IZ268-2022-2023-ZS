                    <h3>Dancehall</h3>
                    <p>Dancehall is one of the many forms of freestyle that grew out of the African diaspora.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dancehall originated from the dance halls of Jamaica, where people would come together to dance.
                        Though the style increased in popularity during the 1970s and ’80s, dance halls existed long
                        before then. It’s a style that’s full of culture. It includes the dance, but also the music,
                        fashion and sense of community. It’s a lifestyle.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dancehall has specific steps, and the social element comes
                        in when dancers perform the steps together. Once you start coming up with your own choreographic
                        combinations, you’re freestyling.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dancehall is about freedom, with a huge serving of personality. It teaches you to
                        perform
                        with confidence and look like you’re having the time of your life.
