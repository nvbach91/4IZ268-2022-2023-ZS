                <p>Our founders were always disappointed by the <b>quality</b> of online dance platforms available on
                    the
                    internet.
                </p>
                <p>Dance is such a big creative sphere with hundreds of different <b>dance styles</b> and a huge ammount
                    of
                    <b>people</b> interested and drawn to it. There's a countless ammount of <b>dancers</b> and
                    choreographers
                    all around the globe, that still are struggling to connect with each other and share their
                    knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>Dance is such a spere where <b>sharing</b> information, skills and experience with one another is the
                    key
                    part to become successful, grow and improve your skills.
                </p>
                <p>That's why our founders decided to <b>together</b> on creating an <b>easy-to-use, high quality</b>
                    international
                    online dance platform that would be available to people in <b>any part of the world</b>.
                </p>
                <p>You can either be a student and learn <b>new</b> styles and techniques from someone or you can become
                    an
                    instructor and <b>share</b> your knowledge and way of dancing with others(after a small background
                    check
                    and
                    skillset check).

                <h4>Miki</h4>
                <p>Miki started dancing when she was only 3 years old. Her mom wanted her to be a professional
                    ballerina, so she
                    started with ballet. But soon enough Miki got a passion to more modern dance styles, starting
                    with jazz modern
                    she later became the best student in her dancehall team. Now it's her primary passion but she is
                    also interested
                    in growing in other styles but she could rarely take classes from the top choreographers as they
                    all lived on
                    a different side of the globe, that's what made her first think about creating the Ddance
                    project

                <h4>Dani</h4>
                <p>Dani on the other side discovered world of dance for himslef very recently. He used to do sports
                    as a child but
                    never was able to control his body as good as dancers do, that's why he thought of trying to try
                    dancing.
                    It doesn't need to be said that he immediately fell in love but the problem was that he used to
                    live in a small
                    town where there was no proper enviroment for learning to dance. That's how he came up with an
                    idea of a website
                    that would connect dancers and teachers independent of their location. Later on he found a like
                    minded person Miki
                    that he started to make this idea become reality.
