                    <h2>Pellets</h2>
                    <p>Many pet owners provide a pelleted feed for their guinea pig. Combined with other quality foods,
                        this
                        can be a
                        convenient way to ensure your guinea pig is getting necessary nutrients. Be sure to choose a top
                        quality pellet to
                        promote the good health of your pet.</p>
                    <p>Plain dye free high quality guinea pig pellets (mixes with nuts are considered too rich),
                        formulated with Vitamin C can
                        be provided in a small heavy ceramic bowl to prevent tipping and cleaned daily. Each guinea pig
                        will eat approximately
                        1/8 cup of pellets a day when also fed adequate hay and fresh vegetables. Purchase pellets in
                        small quantities and store
                        in a dry cool dark place to preserve the potency of the C (look for a pellet with an expiration
                        date to check for
                        freshness). Look for a pellet that uses stabilized vitamin C and has a "Best If Used By" date to
                        ensure quality. Avoid
                        pellets that use animal byproducts and those whose primary ingredient is corn.</p>

                    <h2>Vitamins</h2>
                    <p>Vitamin C is of utmost importance to guinea pigs, as they are unable to manufacture their own
                        (much like humans).
                        Without enough vitamin C in their diets, guinea pigs can become very ill with scurvy.1 The
                        amount of vitamin C required
                        varies somewhat depending on the reference source used, but most guinea pigs probably need about
                        10–20 mg/day. Pregnant,
                        nursing, young, and ill guinea pigs need more.</p>
                    <p>The best way to supplement with additional vitamin C is to use vitamin C tablets.1 You can buy
                        vitamin C tablets
                        specifically for guinea pigs (e.g. Oxbow's GTN-50C) or human chewable 100 mg tablets (note: make
                        sure you are getting
                        just vitamin C rather than a multivitamin formula). A quarter of a 100 mg tablet daily is a
                        recommended dose for most
                        adult guinea pigs. The guinea pig tablets are 50 mg, but since vitamin C is a water-soluble
                        vitamin, small excesses over
                        that daily requirement are easily excreted. Many guinea pigs will take the tablets like a treat
                        and eat them, or they
                        can be crushed and sprinkled on vegetables or pellets.</p>

                    <h2>Hay</h2>
                    <p>Hay should be a staple in the diet and a fresh supply available at all times. Grass hays such as
                        Timothy hay or orchard
                        grass are the best for adult guinea pigs. Alfalfa is richer and higher in calcium and is a good
                        supplement for growing
                        guinea pigs as well as pregnant or nursing guinea pigs, but is not a good staple for most adult
                        guinea pigs.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Vegetables and Fruit</h2>
                    <p>In addition to the hay and pellets, a variety of fresh vegetables (especially leafy greens) and
                        some fruits should be
                        offered daily. Leafy greens should make up the bulk of the vegetable supplementation. Fruits and
                        other vegetables can be
                        offered in small quantities. Avoid iceberg (head lettuce) as it has very little nutritional
                        value.3 Good choices include
                        kale, spinach, turnip greens, parsley, romaine lettuce, and dandelion greens. Avoid or limit
                        cabbage, broccoli,
                        cauliflower, collards, bok choy, and other cruciferous vegetables as they can lead to gas
                        production in the digestive
                        tract.4 Also, avoid starchy vegetables such as potatoes. Carrots, carrot tops, green and red
                        bell peppers, apple,
                        apricots, bananas, blueberries, cantaloupe, grapes, oranges, strawberries, and tomatoes can also
                        be fed. If you have a
                        guaranteed pesticide-free source, grass, dandelions, clover, and chickweed can also be offered,
                        especially new growth
                        which is tender and the most nutritious.</p>
                    <p>Any greens, vegetables, or fruits should be introduced gradually or a digestive upset may result.
