                    <h2>Diarrhea</h2>
                    <p>Guinea pigs have a sensitive gastrointestinal tract (as do rabbits). They have a very specific
                        natural population of 'good' gastrointestinal bacteria (flora) critical to normal bowel
                        function. If this normal bacterial flora becomes altered or unbalanced, 'bad’ (often
                        gas-producing) bacteria can overgrow, produce painful gas, slow down digestion and food passage
                        through the intestinal tract, damage the intestinal tissues, release toxins, cause severe
                        diarrhea, and in severe cases, death. This condition is referred to as gastrointestinal (or GI)
                        stasis. In addition to bacterial infections, some intestinal parasites, like Cryptosporidium and
                        coccidia, can cause diarrhea.</p>

                    <h2>Scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency)</h2>
                    <p>Guinea pigs and primates cannot manufacture their own vitamin C; therefore, they must take in
                        vitamin C in their diets.
                        The majority of other animals can produce their own vitamin C through their intestinal bacterial
                        flora, but guinea pigs
                        and primates are unable to do this. Vitamin C is vital to the normal development and maintenance
                        of skin, joints, and
                        mucosal surfaces, such as the gums. It is also important in the healing of wounds. As well as
                        predisposing the guinea
                        pig to skin problems, a lack of vitamin C makes the body more prone to the development of other
                        diseases, including
                        infections. A guinea pig that has a rough hair coat, is off his food, has diarrhea, is reluctant
                        to walk, seems painful,
                        has swollen feet or joints, or has hemorrhages and ulcers on its gums or skin, is likely to be
                        deficient in vitamin C.</p>

                    <h2>Tumors</h2>
                    <p>Guinea pigs get various tumors; skin and mammary (breast) tumors are particularly common. They
                        can be benign or
                        malignant (cancer). Any mass should be brought to the attention of your veterinarian. In many
                        cases, surgical removal is
                        curative.</p>

                <article>
                    <h2>Abscesses</h2>
                    <p>Abscesses (infected swelling containing an accumulation of pus and bacteria) can affect lymph
                        nodes, skin, muscles,
                        teeth, bones, and internal organs. Since guinea pigs (and other rodents and rabbits) form thick
                        pus that does not drain
                        or get reabsorbed easily, most abscesses in these animals require surgical removal
                        (debridement), followed by treatment
                        with antibiotics chosen based on culture of the bacteria growing in the abscess. Some abscesses
                        (like those involving
                        the jaw and teeth) are more challenging to treat, as affected teeth and bone must be removed
                        along with all the infected
                        soft tissues.</p>

                    <h2>Urinary Problems</h2>
                    <p>Guinea pigs are very prone to development of urinary calculi (stones or uroliths). These stones
                        most often form in the
                        bladder but may also form in the kidneys or ureters (tubes that drain the kidneys into the
                        bladder). Stones may become
                        lodged in the ureter or the urethra (the tube carrying urine from the bladder to the outside),
                        causing a
                        life-threatening obstruction.</p>

                    <h2>Parasites and Skin Problems</h2>
                    <p>Guinea pigs (especially young ones) are prone to ringworm, which is an infection of the skin with
                        a fungus, not with a
                        worm. Certain animals may be ringworm carriers without showing any signs of illness. They can
                        spread the disease to
                        susceptible animals or develop disease themselves if stressed by overcrowding, poor nutrition,
                        the presence of other
                        diseases, or other environmental stresses. The skin affected by ringworm can be itchy, lose
                        hair, and develop crusty
                        scabs. Ringworm lesions are found most commonly around the face, head, and ears, but can spread
                        to the back and legs.
                        After diagnosis by your veterinarian, affected guinea pigs are treated topically and/or orally
                        with anti-fungal
                        medications.</p>
                </article>

                    <h2>Other Problems</h2>
                    <p>Barbering is a problem, usually associated with boredom, in which the guinea pig chews or barbers
                        its own hair or the
                        hair of its cage-mate, so that the barbered pig looks like it has been given a brush cut.
                        Treatment involves providing
                        the guinea pig with more stimulation, redirecting its attention to other chewing activities by
                        offering more hay or chew
                        toys, and separating guinea pigs if they are barbering each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pododermatitis, or bumblefoot, in which sores develop on the bottom of the feet from pressure,
                        is common in guinea pigs.
                        It occurs most often in overweight animals housed on wire-bottomed or dirty cages that abrade
                        the feet, making them
                        susceptible to chronic, deep bacterial infection that causes lameness and pain. Treatment is
                        challenging, but with
                        appropriate veterinary care, including surgery, foot bandages, and antibiotics, the problem can
                        be alleviated.</p>
