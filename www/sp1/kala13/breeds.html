                    <h2>Abyssinian Guinea Pig</h2>
                    <p>The Abyssinian is a great choice for first-time owners because of its extremely affectionate
                        personality. It requires
                        only a bit of training in its eight-year lifespan. Recognize one by spotting eight symmetrical
                        swirls (formally called
                        rosettes), giving it a messy hairdo. You can also adopt the Abyssinian Satin breed which has a
                        glossy fur.</p>

                    <h2>Alpaca Guinea Pig</h2>
                    <p>Considered one of the most beautiful breeds, Alpacas have wavy, coarse fur. Daily brushing and
                        de-tangling is needed,
                        making this breed a bit high maintenance. Although it isn't officially recognized by the ACBA,
                        an Alpaca can live up to
                        eight years.</p>

                    <h2>American Guinea Pig</h2>
                    <p>As the most common breed, the American Guinea Pig by default wins the popularity contest. They
                        are known for their great
                        temperament and also get along well with other piggies. Its short, smooth coat makes it easy to
                        take of, particularly
                        for children.</p>

                    <h2>Coronet Guinea Pig</h2>
                    <p>A Coronet can be identified by its flowing, voluminous mane that doesn't have a part. This sweet
                        ball of fur craves
                        attention and easily attracts it with its curious personality and playful behavior. If you're
                        considering adopting one,
                        make sure you set aside time every day to brush its beautiful coat.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Himalayan Guinea Pig</h2>
                    <p>Himalayans are considered the Siamese cats of the guinea pig world. This albino breed has a white
                        coat with brown or
                        black coloring on its ears, feet, and nose. This breed is recommended for people who live in a
                        colder climate, and away
                        from sun. When a Himalayan is put in direct sunlight or in hot weather, their dark spots fade.
                        This also happens if the
                        guinea is sick, shocked, or scared. They do best indoors and can live up to seven years. The
                        breed isn't officially
                        recognized by the ACBA.
