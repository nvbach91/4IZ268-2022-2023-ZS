                    <h3>Juggling with cards?</h3>
                    <p>Cardistry is an interesting type of juggling involving cards. People, who take part in cardistry,
                        are called cardists. This use of poker cards was popularized by Dan &amp; Dave Buck in 2010s.
                        These twins are behind popular series of cards called Smoke &amp; Mirrors, popular both with
                        cardists and magicians.</p>
                    <p>Instagram is favourite platform to share short videos of new cardistry flourishes and cuts.
                        However, there are also many videos uploaded to YouTube. One of the high quaility productions
                        was done by the Virtuoso, group of very skilled and precise cardists from Asia. You can play the
                        video to see what is possible with a deck of poker cards and a lot of time spent practicing.</p>

                    <h3>How did you do that?</h3>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of magic (coin magic, mentalism etc.), however, we are talking
                        about poker cards. Therefore card magic has to be mentioned here. There are countless ways to
                        fool someone with cards, some more complicated and time demanding than others. Nevertheless, it
                        is important to learn more than just sleight of hand. Magic also involves acting and
                        improvisation to a certain degree.</p>
                    <p>Card magic itself can be perfomed in different ways, too (like it is not already complicated
                        enough with magic). Some of the ways are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tabble hopping - involves going around in a restaurant or other facilities and performing
                            for an isolated group of people.</li>
                        <li>Street magic - usually performing to random people on the street or in public spaces, who
                            walk by and are willing to take a few minutes off their time.</li>
                        <li>Stage magic - performing on a stage in theatre or in a bar setting, usually involves one or
                            a few members of the audience directly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Watch the video to see Ondřej Pšenička perform his magic routine to two of the most famous and
                        knowledgable magicians in the world - Penn &amp; Teller.</p>
