            <p>The world of playing card designs shows huge variety. That in itself is amazing because it allows
                everybody to find something they enjoy. You can find designs inspired by your hobby or featuring your
                favourite colors or patterns. Some decks are aimed more towards collectors while others for cardists or
                magicians to perform with. Searching for minimalistic design? Or very intricate luxurious decks? Or
                playing cards whose tuck case takes inspiration from origami to create unusual and very aesthetically
                pleasing opening? The possibilities are nearly endless!</p>
            <p>Many designers may catch your attention and it is nearly impossible to list them all without boring you
                to sleep. I have picked five of my favourite designers or brands to showcase different approaches to
                creating a deck from the scratch. Pick one from the menu buttons under this paragraph to scroll to and
                learn more about.</p>

                    <h3>Style</h3>
                    <p>Over his active years, Luke Wadey created his own unique style that is instantly recognizable
                        amongst the playing card community members. His series of decks called "Mono" focus on modern
                        designs mainly for cardistry (but can be used for magic as well) using a single color. A series
                        called "Grid." takes completely different approach taking advantage of Luke's professional
                        career as a graphic designer. It is full of typography and very unique style separating his
                        typographic decks from the rest.</p>

                        designs he was able to deliver over the decade of his designing journey. The vast majority of
                        his decks are aimed at collectors due to use of foils during manufacturing and completely
                        redrawn faces. Despite the complexity of each deck, Lorenzo is able to consistently produce many
                        amazing decks.</p>

                    <p>The abbreviation J&#38;T appears in every design of this company's new decks. However, it is
                        always hidden in the intricate design of the box and/or cards. Joker &#38; the Thief managed to
                        penetrate both cardistry and collector worlds and continues to do so. Their most cardistry
                        oriented deck is called simply "597". This minimalist approach is shown also in the design,
                        which is complete opposite to anything they realeased before. You cannot step in the wrong
                        direction with J&#38;T cards no matter what you are looking for.</p>

                    <p>Daniel Schneider became known for his flexibility when it comes to his work. He can do classic
                        designs inspired by the most printed deck ever - the Bicycle Rider Back - and put his own twist
                        to it. That's where the Black Roses Playing Cards come in. The main design element is a rose and
                        with some curls it creates amazing deck for any magician or casual user of playing cards. A
                        minimalistic Hotel Casino deck series, which is one of the more recent endeavours of Daniel, is
                        also based on the Black Roses rose logo design. The ability to create modern designs shows
                        through in Orbit Playing Cards series. Each edition is different to the previous one. The main
                        inspiration for all Orbit decks comes from space, however lately also featured a scene of San
                        Diego's beach and view of its downtown on the second installment of Orbit Cardistry Con Edition.
