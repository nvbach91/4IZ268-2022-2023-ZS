                <p>When you take into consideration that about 100 million decks of poker cards are printed each year by
                    a single US company (eventhough it is the largest one), there must be a great demand for them.
                    Millions of decks are printed just for casinos alone, then you have retailers selling cards in brick
                    and mortar stores for card games and there is also a considerable growing market for custom playing
                    cards. I have chosen three of the most known and used companies, which are in the business of
                    printing poker cards. Read on to get to know a little bit about them.</p>

                    <div class="paragraphs">
                        <p>The United States Playing Card Company is considered one of the best, if not the best, in
                            regards of quality and feel of the paper used for poker cards. They are also suppliers of
                            casino decks across United States and in many other countries. The estimate of 100 million
                            decks a year they produce, which was mentioned in the introduction paragraph, is from one
                            fifth consumed by casinos. In the playing card community, USPCC is considered the "gold
                            standard" for quality cards.</p>
                        <p>They are, however, notorious for problems with alignment while cutting cards from uncut
                            sheets and you sometimes end up with crooked borders on the deck. This fact is especially
                            noticeable when design features a really thin border. It is sort of a running joke in the
                            community. Despite the occasional hickup, USPCC is the most popular manufacturer of playing
                            cards there is.</p>
                        <p>The United States Playing Card Company was recently acquired by Cartamundi, which brings us
                            to the following manufacturer...</p>

                        <p>Cartamundi started as a printer for card games and board game card accessories and they
                            became a huge international company. Then they decided to join the poker playing cards
                            market with their own deck called "Copag 310" trying to compete with Bicycle Rider Back
                            deck. They became known for their True Linen finish, which seems like a small lines
                            imprinted in paper. On the contrary, the USPCC uses Air Cushion finish, which is like a
                            network of tiny squares.</p>
                        <p>The first decks were printed on great paper stock called B9, however, the decks were a lot
                            thicker, by about 10 cards than Retail stock of USPCC. Nevertheless, Cartamundi was able to
                            catch up on this small bump on their road to customers and continues to produce great
                            quality decks.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned before, Cartamundi acquired USPCC in 2020. Even though it may sound like they
                            got rid of a great competition, they let USPCC run the way it was up to the acquisition,
                            which still kept the variety of stocks and finishes on the market.</p>
                        <p>Cartamundi is also a large scale printer just like USPCC with minimum order of 1000 decks.
                            Cartamundi can also print just 200 prototype decks, which comes at very high cost per deck.
                            If you want to prototype a deck and want just one, you don't have to worry, the following
                            manufacturer has you covered!</p>

                        <p>Make Playing Cards company became known thanks to the opportunity to print just a single deck
                            of whatever design you please. This allows designers to print prototypes according to the
                            exact demand they face. These decks usually end up in hands of photographers to create
                            product photos for Kickstarter campaigns or preorders. The other usual usecase is for
                            limited editions of certain decks, like Kickstarter exclusives, since you don't have to sell
                            all 200 or 1000 decks like with Cartamundi or USPCC.</p>
                        <p>Cards from the MPC do not match the quality of Cartamundi or USPCC, however, they got up to
                            speed fast and may catch up during the following years. Jumps in the quality are
                            indisputable.</p>
                        <p>MPC also prints their own decks, they made an entrance by printing special edition decks for
                            Cardistry Con in 2018 and also 2019. The step up in quality with their BETA finish was
                            amazing surprise to all playing cards enthusiasts.</p>
