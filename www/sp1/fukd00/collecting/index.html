                <h2 class="article-heading">Want to start your collection?</h2>
                <p>If you want to start collecting playing cards, I have a friendly warning for you. It may get
                    addictive once you fully get into it. There are a lot of way to collect playing cards. You can start
                    with a single brand or just a single series by one of the brands out there. You can also collect
                    cards with a certain color since many designs feature just that and the white of the paper to make
                    the design pop. Possibilities are endless and the decision is completely up to you.</p>
                <p>There are two major communities or places where you can talk about playing cards and search for the
                    next one to get to your collection. I excluded eBay just because it is only used to selling and
                    there is no community aspect to it. However you will most definitely encounter it unless you
                    directly buy the deck from someone based on agreement.</p>

                        <p>Instagram became a harbour of playing card content over the years. You can find basically all
                            enthusiasts there no matter the favourite activity - collecting, magic, cardistry, art made
                            of playing cards... You name it. We are here to talk about collecting though. Many
                            collectors share pictures of their precious collections, ways to display them, and their
                            most priced white whale decks (basically decks that are insanely rare and/or expensive
                            beyond belief for a single stack of hard paper in a paper box).</p>
                        <p>One thing about Instagram is that it is focused on a individual, after all it is a content
                            sharing platform. That makes is kind of weird since you have to reach out to other people
                            via direct messages. Fear not however, as scary as it may sound, majority of the people in
                            the community is very friendly and happy to chat. They might also point you in direction of
                            what you are looking for.</p>
                        <p>Great place to start exploring Instagram's playing card community is via hashtags. You can
                            click the button below, which will take you to one of the most popular hashtags in the
                            community.</p>

                        <p>The United Cardists forum is the opposite of Instagram. The great advantage of forum threads
                            is that you can join a conversation at any time and read what has been said so far. You can
                            also start a new conversation thread or look around if there is a thread that already
                            answers your question. The feeling of community is far stronger than on Instagram.</p>
                        <p>You need an account to contribute to threads and create new ones, however if you want to just
                            browse and read, you don't need one.</p>
                        <p>The forum features many topics including reviews of playing cards, new upcoming decks and
                            also threads, where companies can post news regarding their work so people have official
                            source. Other than that you can also get help and input if you are working on a design for a
                            deck of your own. The forum also has its own marketplace section where you can sell or trade
                            your cards.</p>

                    <p>This website is probably the best tool to keep track of your collection. Everyone from the
                        community works on adding new decks that are not there yet and filling in the missing
                        information about each already existing deck or its designer. The user interface is quite simple
                        to get familiar with so you can start adding your decks in matter of minutes after creating an
                        account and logging in.</p>
                    <p>Many functionalities have been added since the first version of the website. Apart from the
                        obvious - collection of decks creating your Collection - there is the Wishlist, where you can
                        add decks you are currently looking for. Another collection of decks is called the Trade List.
                        This serves only one purpouse - listing extra decks you have up for trade or sale. All of this
                        makes is much simpler and nicer than trying to keep a spread sheet in Excel. Plus you can share
                        your profile with others and see what you can trade.</p>
