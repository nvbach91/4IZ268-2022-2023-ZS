                <p>Commerzbank is the leading bank for the German Mittelstand and a strong partner for around 28,000

                <div class="div-article">
                    <h3>Our strategy </h3>
                    <p>We are combining the advantages of a digitalised bank with personal advisory services, consistent
                        customer focus, and sustainability. Our “Strategy 2024” represents customer centricity,
                        digitalisation, sustainability, and profitability. We put profitability before growth. We want
                        to
                        create added value – for our clients, our employees, our investors and shareholders, and for
                        society
                        as a whole. We are set on a clear objective: We want to become the digital advisory bank for
                        Germany.</p>
                    <h3>Private and Small-Business Customers segment</h3>
                    <p>We will evolve the segment into an attractive combination of a highly efficient direct bank and
                        first-class advisory offering. Going forward, we will have 450 locations all across Germany
                        where
                        customers are offered advice on issues like account, card, and consumer credit, as well as being
                        supported in the use of digital offerings. Private and small-business customers with a greater
                        requirement for advisory services will receive comprehensive personal support and individual
                        solutions on all issues related to investing and financing.</p>
                    <h3>Corporate Clients segment</h3>
                    <p>In the Corporate Clients Segment, we are continuing our success story in the German Mittelstand.
                        With
                        a lean and digitalised product range, we will in future focus on customers with German
                        connectivity.
                        We will only further provide advisory services for international corporate clients if they are
                        operating in selected future-oriented sectors such as mobility, sustainability, communications,
                        life
                        sciences, and capital goods. Our international branch network maintains an important role
                        accompanying the German economy into the world and bringing the world to Germany.</p>
                    <h3>Commerzbank as an employer</h3>
                    <p>Digitalisation provides us with opportunities to better and faster meet our customers’ wishes and
                        needs. In order to do so, we, as Commerzbank, must change too: put the traditional bank behind
                        us
                        and drive technological progress in the digital age. And that’s exactly why we need employees
                        who
                        will walk this path with us. Our corporate culture is characterised by openness, mutual respect,
                        cultural diversity, and a strong team spirit. The compatibility of private life and career is an
                        important issue for us. That’s why we offer our employees many ways to work flexibly: be it
                        different working time models and part-time options or mobile working and partial retirement
                        programmes.</p>

                        <p>&#9656;</p>In 1870 a number of merchants, merchant bankers and private bankers founded the
                        Commerz- und
                        Disconto-Bank in Hamburg. As of around 1900, its business focussed increasingly on Berlin. It
                        became
                        one of the country's leading big banks with an extensive branch network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#9656;</p>Milestones along the way include the merger in 1920 with the Mitteldeutsche
                        Privat-Bank, a regional
                        bank based in Magdeburg, and in 1929 with the Mitteldeutsche Creditbank based in Frankfurt am
                        Main.
                        In the wake of the crisis in the banking sector, the government ordered the merger in early 1932
                        of
                        Commerzbank with the Barmer Bank-Verein Hinsberg, Fischer & Co. in Düsseldorf. In 1940, the name
                        Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, by which the bank was generally known, was officially adopted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>&#9656;</p>With the division of Europe after the war, Commerzbank lost some 45 % of its
                        premises. The process
                        of decentralisation of the big banks in West German resulted in a breakdown into three regional
                        banks, which were united in 1958 as 'Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft', which had its headquarters
                        in
                        Düsseldorf. Commerzbank stepped up its retail banking activities and built up a nationwide
                        network.
                        At around the same time, it started expanding around the globe. From 1970 onwards, the bank's
                        administrative activities were shifted to Frankfurt am Main, which has been its legal domicile
                        since
                        1990.
