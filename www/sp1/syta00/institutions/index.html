                <p>Commerzbank AG and its branches, affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively referred to hereinafter as
                    Commerzbank) are firmly committed to participating in international efforts to prevent money
                    laundering
                    and the financing of terrorism. To this end Commerzbank has implemented a programme to prevent its
                    products and services from being misused for such criminal activity in compliance with applicable
                    rules
                    and international best practices.</p>
                <p>Commerzbank has its headquarters in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and is supervised by<br>
                    &#9656; the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority<br>
                    &#9656; the EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK Banking Supervision
                </p>
                <p>As a member of the European Union, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, and the Basle
                    Committee on Banking Supervision, Germany has enacted laws and regulations designed to implement the
                    policies of these authorities.</p>
                <p>In furtherance of that commitment, Commerzbank adheres to transparency by publishing relevant

                <div>
                    <p>On 1 July 2014 the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act has come into effect, with implications for
                        financial institutions operating within the U.S., as well as abroad. FATCA expands the existing
                        documentation, reporting, and withholding requirements related to U.S. taxpayers investing
                        outside
                        the U.S., in an effort to minimize U.S. tax evasion.</p>
                    <p>Many countries including Germany have signed Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) with the U.S.,
                        allowing foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in those countries to comply with FATCA
                        obligations
                        without breaching national data protection laws.</p>
                    <p>Commerzbank AG and its branches, affiliates and subsidiaries worldwide (collectively referred to
                        hereinafter as Commerzbank) are fully committed to providing the required FATCA information
                        under
                        the U.S. Regulations and IGAs in order to help combat tax evasion. </p>
                    <p>Commerzbank itself has registered and obtained GIINs for group members. The IRS assigned the
                        following GIIN to Commerzbank AG, Frankfurt, Germany: G51Q21.00000.LE.276</p>
                    <p>For a list of GIINs of Commerzbank branches and subsidiaries abroad please refer to the download
                        section of this page.</p>
                    <p>The GIINs have been published by the IRS on the FFI List.</p>
