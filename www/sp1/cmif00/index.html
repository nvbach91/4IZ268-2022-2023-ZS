                        <h2>Bruno scores two as Portugal progress</h2>
                        <p>Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes scored both goals for Portugal as they beat Uruguay 2-0 to secure their qualification to the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup.
                            Our no.8 was in superb form as he netted his match-winning brace, firstly opening the scoring after 54 minutes, when his looping cross narrowly evaded the head of former Reds team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo to find the back of the net.
                            With the game teetering on a knife edge in injury time, Fernandes forced a penalty when he superbly knocked the ball through the legs of Jose Maria Gimenez and the Atletico Madrid man handled it as he fell to the ground.
                            After a VAR check, Alireza Faghani awarded a spot-kick and Bruno confidently stepped up to take it himself, firing past Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and ensuring Portugal's progression in the competition.

                        <h2>Garnacho the young star</h2>
                        <p>Alejandro Garnacho was named United’s Player of the Month for November last week, after a blistering few weeks in the first team.
                            The exciting forward, who turned 18 earlier this year, sat down with us at Carrington after being presented with the award.
                            “It’s an honour for me, being able to be named Player of the Month for this last month,” began Garnacho.
                            “It has been a fantastic one for me. I’m very happy now and the main thing is, apart from individual awards, to also win prizes as a group.”

                        <h2>Reds star in Brazil win</h2>
                        <p>Manchester United’s Antony, Casemiro and Fred featured for Brazil as they kicked off their 2022 World Cup campaign with victory over Serbia.
                            The five-time winners of the competition triumphed 2-0 at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, ensuring that they put an early three points on the board in Group G. 
                            Tottenham forward Richarlison got both of the difference-making strikes in the second half, with the latter - an acrobatic effort - an instant Goal of the Tournament contender.
                            Midfielfer Casemiro was the only one in the starting lineup, however Fred and Anthony were both able to make their apperances later in the game.
