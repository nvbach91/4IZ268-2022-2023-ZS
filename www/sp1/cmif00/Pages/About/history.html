        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The club was founded in 1878 under the name Newton Heath. We first started competing in the English first division in the 1892/93 season and ten years after that 
            we changed the name to Manchester United.
            In 1908 came the first of many successes. Manchester United won their first English League title.
            In 1910 we moved to our current stadium - Old Trafford.
            Afterward we continued with strong displays in the English top flight, mainly in the 40s and 50s when Sir Matt Butsby coached the team.
        </p>

        <h2 class="undertitle">1958</h2>
        <p>
            In 1958 came a terrible accident. A plane with the players and the coach crashed when flying above Munich. The crash resulted in the death of eight players.
            Global support and tributes followed, but they could not revive those, who were lost in the accident. Butsby was able to rebuild the team around popular 
            players such as George Best, Bobby Charleton and Dennis Law. In 1968 these players won the European Cup final and Manchester United became the first 
            English side to win this title.
        </p>
        <h2 class="undertitle">Sir Alex Fergusson</h2>
        <p>In 1986 the club appointed a new manager. A well known Scottish coach named Alex Fergusson. Fergusson had a clear plan and an unmatched work ethic, he was immidiatelly able
            to help the club improve. In 1990 this improvement materialised as United won the FA cup. A period of successes followed. Since 1992 we have won the Premier League title 
            a record 13 times, 12 FA cups were won, 4 League Cups and most importantly 3 Champions League titles came to Old Trafford. This makes us the most succesful club in England.
        </p>
        <img class="article-img" src="../../Resources/sir_alex.jpg" alt="Sir Alex Fergusson">
        <p>Sir Alex Fergusson retired at the end of the 2012/13 season and was replaced by David Moyes. Since then multiple managers were in charge of Manchester United, however none of
            them could replicate the success of Sir Alex.
        </p>
        <p>Currently the manager in charge is the Dutch Maestro Erik Ten Hag, who has shown a clear vision and plan. We know that this club is in good hands.</p>
