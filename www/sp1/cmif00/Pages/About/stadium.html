        <h1>Old Trafford</h1>
        <p>
            Our home stadium, Old Trafford also known as the Theatre of Dreams was originally opened on February 19, 1910 with a capacity of 80 000. 
            During the second World war the stadium was badly damaged by the Germans. The stadium had to be rebuilt and was again opened in 1949. During the 50s a 
            plethera of upgrades to the stadium took place, such as the addition of floodlights, and roofs covering the stands.
        </p>
        <img class="article-img" src="../../Resources/Theatre_of_dreams.webp" alt="Theatre of Dreams">
        <p>The next upgrade took place in 1992, when Old Trafford was converted into a all seater stadium. This reduced the capacity to 44 000 seats, the lowest, since the stadium
            was built. Afterwards many expansions took place to increase the capacity. Currently the stadium has 75 454 seats, which is one of the highest in England.

        <p>
            Why is Old Trafford called the Theatre of Dreams?
        </p>
        <p>This name comes from a Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charleton, the legendary United player coined the phrase "This is Manchester United Football CLub, this is The Theatre of Dreams",
            the phrase has stuck ever since.
