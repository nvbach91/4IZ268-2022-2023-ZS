        <h1>Ronaldo is leaving</h1>
        <p>
            Cristiano Ronaldo is to leave Manchester United by mutual agreement, with immediate effect.
            The club thanks him for his immense contribution across two spells at Old Trafford, scoring 145 goals in 346 appearances, and wishes him and his family well for the future.
            Everyone at Manchester United remains focused on continuing progress under Erik ten Hag and working together to deliver success on the pitch.
         </p>

         <p> 
            Cristiano Ronaldo first joined Manchester United in 2003, when he was just a youngster. Manchester United payed over 12 milion pounds for his transfer making him the most expensive teenager in 
            the Premier League. Immediately everyone knew, that he was special, however it took him a while to get used to English football.
         </p>
         <p>
            His first successful season came in 2006/07, when he scored 17 times and assisted 8 in the English top flight. During this season Manchester United also won the Premier League, which was the first one for Cristiano. 
         </p>

            <p>
             But the 06/07 season was nothing compared to 2007/08. During that season Cristiano Ronaldo was able to score 31 times, which was a record in the Premier League. On top of that he was able to win
             the Premier League with Manchester United once again. But that was not all, they also won the Big One - The Champions League. Ronaldo was by far the best player of this team. Actually he became the best player
             in the world, when he was awarded the Ballon d'or in December of 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2009 Ronaldo transfered to his dream club Real Madrid, where he only continued to impress.

        <p>
        2021 was the year when Ronaldo came back home and what a return it was. On his second debut he was able to score not one, but two goals to seal a 4-1 victory against Newcastle. And the goals kept coming
        during 2021/22 he was able to net 18 times in the Premier League, which was the most a Manchester United player scored since, well himself in 2009, when he also scored 18.
        </p>
        <p>
        This season Cristiano has decided he wants to hone his craft at another club and we will not stand in his way. Goodbye Cristiano
