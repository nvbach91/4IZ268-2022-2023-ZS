        <h1>Eriksen names his two football idols</h1>
        <p> Who are the two idols of the Danish midfielder?
            The Manchester United midfielder, currently in Qatar to represent Denmark at the World Cup, took part in one of our popular Fans' Q&A sessions recently, and was asked by one supporter, 
            Ram in Singapore, about his idols growing up. Two legends came to mind for the 30-year-old, and both were creative geniuses just like Cristian himself.
         </p> 
         <p> 
            "I had two," was Christian's answer. "[Francesco] Totti because I played Football Manager and then, after, it was Laudrup. Michael Laudrup, the one and only.
            "Just because he was Danish and I liked his style."
            Totti played his entire senior club career with Roma, with his 250 goals ensuring he is second in the all-time Serie A scoring list behind only Silvio Piola. He was part of the Italy side that won the World Cup in 2006.

            <p>
                Laudrup, whose brother Brian was also a top player, played for Barcelona and Real Madrid, and two Italian clubs in Lazio and Juventus. 
                The talented forward earned 104 caps for Denmark and was particularly outstanding at the 1986 World Cup finals. He finished his career with Christian's former club Ajax.
                The Danes reached the quarter-finals in 1998 with Laudrup as captain, and Eriksen will be keen to ensure the present side can at least progress to the knockout stages of the current tournament.
                Kasper Hjulmand's men were tagged as dark horses in Qatar but a draw with Tunisia and narrow defeat to France leaves them under pressure ahead of the final Group G games.

        <p>
            Denmark will face Australia at 15:00 GMT on Wednesday, needing to beat the Socceroos to go above them in the table.
            World Cup holders France are safely through with six points already accrued before they take on Tunisia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Look out for Eriksen's Fans' Q&A in full on our official channels from Wednesday morning.
