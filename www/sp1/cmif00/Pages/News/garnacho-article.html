        <h1>Garnacho the young star</h1>
        <p>
            Alejandro Garnacho was named United’s Player of the Month for November last week, after a blistering few weeks in the first team.
            The exciting forward, who turned 18 earlier this year, sat down with us at Carrington after being presented with the award.

         </p> 
         <p> 
            “It’s an honour for me, being able to be named Player of the Month for this last month,” began Garnacho.
            “It has been a fantastic one for me. I’m very happy now and the main thing is, apart from individual awards, to also win prizes as a group.”
        </p>

                Asked for the best moment of his United career to date, however, and the youngster plumped for a moment from October, rather than the last few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’d have to stick with making my full debut, against Sheriff [Tiraspol] which was the moment that marks the start of my career,” he explained.
            </p>
            <p>     
                “We usually get told the starting XI the day before the game and when I saw that I was in the team, I was a little bit nervous to tell you the truth, because it was the first time I’d started the game as first choice in front of all our supporters at Old
                Trafford.
            </p>    
            <p>
                “So the first thing I did was to go back home and tell all the family. They could hardly believe it and we were all very happy.”

        <p>
            Garnacho had to wait until his second start, against Real Sociedad, for his first senior goal. And even though the maiden start might remain his best United moment so far, he describes his strike in San Sebastian in even more emotional terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think I’d have to say it’s the sweetest moment of my life so far really,” he admits. “My first goal as a full professional.
        </p>    
        <p>
            “My family and my friends and everyone were there to see me, and it was a really good goal. And I was very happy and proud of being able to get on the scoresheet wearing this shirt.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Garnacho thanked the fans who voted for him in the poll to decide the award, which saw him edge Casemiro and David De Gea for the prize, and said he’d always felt their support, even before he made the senior team.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Right from the moment I arrived here, all the fans have accepted me really well,” he smiled. “They have always got behind us, in the junior sides and now I’ve made it to here [the first team]. They’ve aways supported us at every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            “So I’d like to thank everyone who voted for me to win this award.”
