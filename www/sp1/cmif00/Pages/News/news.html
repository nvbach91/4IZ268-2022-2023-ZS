                    <h2>Bruno scores two as Portugal progress</h2>
                    <p>Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes scored both goals for Portugal as they beat Uruguay 2-0 to secure their qualification to the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup.
                        Our no.8 was in superb form as he netted his match-winning brace, firstly opening the scoring after 54 minutes, when his looping cross narrowly evaded the head of former Reds team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo to find the back of the net.
                        With the game teetering on a knife edge in injury time, Fernandes forced a penalty when he superbly knocked the ball through the legs of Jose Maria Gimenez and the Atletico Madrid man handled it as he fell to the ground.
                        After a VAR check, Alireza Faghani awarded a spot-kick and Bruno confidently stepped up to take it himself, firing past Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and ensuring Portugal's progression in the competition.

                    <p>Alejandro Garnacho was named United’s Player of the Month for November last week, after a blistering few weeks in the first team.
                        The exciting forward, who turned 18 earlier this year, sat down with us at Carrington after being presented with the award.
                        “It’s an honour for me, being able to be named Player of the Month for this last month,” began Garnacho.
                        “It has been a fantastic one for me. I’m very happy now and the main thing is, apart from individual awards, to also win prizes as a group.”

                    <p>Manchester United’s Antony, Casemiro and Fred featured for Brazil as they kicked off their 2022 World Cup campaign with victory over Serbia.
                        The five-time winners of the competition triumphed 2-0 at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, ensuring that they put an early three points on the board in Group G. 
                        Tottenham forward Richarlison got both of the difference-making strikes in the second half, with the latter - an acrobatic effort - an instant Goal of the Tournament contender.
                        Midfielfer Casemiro was the only one in the starting lineup, however Fred and Anthony were both able to make their apperances later in the game.

                        The club thanks him for his immense contribution across two spells at Old Trafford, scoring 145 goals in 346 appearances, and wishes him and his family well for the future.
                        Everyone at Manchester United remains focused on continuing progress under Erik ten Hag and working together to deliver success on the pitch.</p>

                <h2>November Player of the Month</h2>
                <p>Initially there were four players chosen for the shortlist. These players being Casemiro, Lisandro Martinez, David de Gea and the young Alejandro Garnacho.
                    After looking deeper into the performances of these four players there is one who towers over the rest. The performances of this man in recent weeks have 
                    skyrocketed his image in the eyes of the supporters and have shown just how much potential he has.

                <p>
                    Manchester United centre-back has been using the winter break to work alongside UNICEF, travelling to The Gambia with the charitable organisation.
                    The defender arrived in the West African country with his wife Maja last week and has since been to schools and hospitals to learn about the issues facing the people living there.
                    During his trip, Victor has been keeping a thread on his Twitter account, documenting the amazing things that he has been doing, the new information that he is taking in, and the way it makes him feel.

                <p>Christian Eriksen has identified the two football heroes he most looked up to in his youth.
                    The Manchester United midfielder, currently representing Denmark at the World Cup finals, took part in one of our popular Fans' Q&A sessions recently, and was asked by one supporter, Ram in Singapore, about his idols growing up.
                    Two legends came to mind for the 30-year-old, and both were creative geniuses and wonderful players to watch strut their stuff.</p>
