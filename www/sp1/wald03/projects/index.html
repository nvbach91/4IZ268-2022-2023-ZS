                    <h3>Short Summary</h3>
                    <p>Chainsaw Man (Japanese: チェンソーマン, Hepburn: Chensō Man) is a Japanese manga series written and
                        illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto. Its first part was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga
                        magazine
                        Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2018 to December 2020; its second part began serialization in
                        Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ online magazine in July 2022. Its chapters have been collected in 12
                        tankōbon volumes as of October 2022. Chainsaw Man follows the story of Denji, an impoverished
                        young
                        man who makes a contract that fuses his body with that of a dog-like devil named Pochita,
                        granting
                        him the ability to transform parts of his body into chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the Public
                        Safety Devil Hunters, a government agency focused on fighting against devils whenever they
                        become a
                        threat to the world.</p>
