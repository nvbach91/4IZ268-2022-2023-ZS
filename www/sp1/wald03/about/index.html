    <h1>Mappa (Animation Studio)</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Mappa was founded in 2011 by Madhouse co-founder and producer Masao Maruyama.
            Murayama served as the company's first representative director, and the studio's initial goal was to produce
            Sunao Katabuchi's In This Corner of the World.
            Due to financial difficulties at Madhouse, Murayama and Katabuchi established MAPPA in the hopes of
            producing the film; however, despite moving studios, the film had a lot of production troubles, and wasn't
            released until 5 years later.
        </p>
        <p>Maruyama stepped down as president in 2016 to form Studio M2. He was replaced by former Studio 4Â°C employee
            Manabu Ootsuka.</p>
