            <p class="p">Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game
                is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against
                seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. There are also multiple modes of
                the game which include: Normal, Ranked, HyperRoll and the most recent release, Double Up. While most of
                these modes are against seven other opponents, Double Up is a special game mode where players have a
                partner and the team plays against six other players who make up the three other teams. The game
                released as a League of Legends game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a
                standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.</p>

            <p class="p">Based on Dota Auto Chess, a mod for Dota 2, the game centers around eight players who construct
                teams to fight one another and be the last player standing.[2] The battlefield consists of hexagons,
                where players can strategically place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between
                rounds. During each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players matched randomly for
                that round, or else paired against computer-controlled enemies. In the rounds against
                computer-controlled enemies, each enemy has a chance to drop gold, units, or items that the player can
                use. Health lost from losing a round is calculated with a combination of set damage per round and how
                many units an opponent had still alive.</p>
