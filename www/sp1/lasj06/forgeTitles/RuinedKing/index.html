            <p class="p">Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is a 2021 turn-based role-playing video game developed
                by Airship Syndicate and published by Riot Forge. A spin-off to Riot Games' League of Legends, Ruined
                King uses characters and a setting originating in its parent title.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="p">The game is set in Bilgewater, a bustling pirate city, and the Shadow Isles, a cursed region
                filled with a corrupting force called the Black Mist. The player controls a party of six characters from
                League of Legends to find the source of the Black Mist. The playable characters are Pyke, Braum, Miss
                Fortune, Illaoi, Ahri, and Yasuo.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="p">Originally revealed in 2019 during the 10th anniversary celebration of League of Legends,
                Ruined King's release was delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A release date was not provided
                by the developer or publisher until it was launched, alongside Hextech Mayhem, on November 16, 2021, for
                Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One. It is backwards compatible with the
                PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with free upgrades to the native versions to be available in the
                future.</p>
