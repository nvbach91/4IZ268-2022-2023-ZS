            <p class="p">Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story is a rhythm video game developed by Choice Provisions
                and published by Riot Forge, a publishing division of Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends.
                Hextech Mayhem was released on 16 November 2021 alongside Ruined King: A League of Legends Story. Both
                games use characters from League of Legends in their story and gameplay.</p>

            <p class="p">Hextech Mayhem received "mixed or average" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.
                Chris Carter of Destructoid gave the game an eight out of ten, praising the game's soundtrack for being
                "...some of Choice Provisions' best work" while appreciating the various mascot platforming homages
                strewn throughout the game. Nintendo World Report praised the game for its sense of flow and criticized
                the numerous technical issues present in the Switch port of the game, calling its framerate drops
                "debilitating" for a rhythm game while calling the freestyle mayhem "frustrating and limiting".</p>
