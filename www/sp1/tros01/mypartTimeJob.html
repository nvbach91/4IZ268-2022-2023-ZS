      <div>
        <p>I am visiting the VŠE for some time now, and earning money for even longer. But I hadnt started my career
          yet, because none of my 'jobs' was anything I would want to do for living.</p>
        <p>But still, I am really pleased by the work I do. Mostly.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Primary income</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <div>
          <p>The company which employs me is named Shameless. And it definitely is not regular job you are used to. Core
            principle of our organization is 100% freedom in picking jobs from those available to you. That means I can
            work for 0h in the whole year, or whenever you are able to. </p>
          <p>That is because the second core principle in practice is: First to come, first to take. It is of course
            possible just because there is enough employyes to cover most of the demand.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>So what is this special job all about?</p>
          <p>Well. You could say, we are roadies. Even thou its not about changing different cities during a tour, but
            clients in the capital city mainly. Our speciality are stages. For concerts, festivals, indoor or outdoor.
            But any other job including cables, sound, lights or just moving things is great match for us anyways.</p>
