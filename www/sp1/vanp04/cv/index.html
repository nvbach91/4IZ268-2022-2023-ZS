          <h3>T-Mobile Czech Republic - (Software Engineering, 2019-2020</h3>
          <p>After I transferred from one university to another, I decided it was time to get some real-life work
            experience.
            I have worked there for a year - basically, til the covid pandemic started. Then I had to leave to focus
            more on my studies.

          <h3>Moneta Money Bank - (Software Enginnering, 2020-2021)</h3>
          <p>After the covid situation settled a bit, I wanted to get back into work. I ended up at Moneta money bank,
            working as a part-time software engineer.
            My work was mainly focused at the mobile banking app.</p>

          <h3>Porsche Engineering - (Data Analytics and Artificial Inteligence, 2021-2022)</h3>
          <p>After a year in my previous job, I decided it was time for a change once again. This time I wanted to do
            something a bit different and see if I would enjoy that more.
            My work at Porsche was mainly about using python for data analytics. I have also worked on self-driving tech
            for some time as well.
