            <p>Sweden, one of the Nordic countries, is a travel destination for a lot of people from around the world.
                Be it the beautiful nature, wealth, or nicely decorated and maintained environment, a lot of people talk
                highly about this country.
            </p>
            <p>I have personally visited this country two times. One time was 10 years ago when I was still a child and
                didn't really pay attention to much of anything.
                The second visit I paid to this country was this year in the summer.
            </p>
            <p>I would recommend anyone to visit this country, especially if money is not a problem for you. Since I am
                still a student, I could not spend as much as I would have wanted to.
                That was probably my only gripe with this country and especially Stockholm. Everything is just so
                pricey, from public transport tickets to food and drink. I would say that this country places among the
                priciest in Europe, topped by Switzerland and a few others.
