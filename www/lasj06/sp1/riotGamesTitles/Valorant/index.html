            <p class="p">Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot
                Games, for Microsoft Windows. Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a
                closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The
                development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of
                tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy
                while moving.</p>

            <p class="p">Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players
                play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In
                the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having
                five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate
                ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each
                round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability
                charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the
                previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an
                assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns,
                shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons
                that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot
                accurately. It currently offers 20 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova,
                Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, Fade and
                Harbor. The player will get 5 unlocked agents (Brimstone, Sova, Sage, Phoenix and Jett) and will have to
                unlock the agents by activating that agent's contract.</p>
