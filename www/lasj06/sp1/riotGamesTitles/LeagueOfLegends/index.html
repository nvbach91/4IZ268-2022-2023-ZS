            <p class="p">League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle
                arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom
                map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its
                release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
                customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="p">In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team
                occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a
                "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more
                powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing
                team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and
                destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="p">League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its
                accessibility, character designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a
                critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively; the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its
                players, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the
                problem. In 2019, League regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has
                led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an animated series, Arcane. Its
                success has also spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile version, a digital collectible
                card game and a turn-based role-playing game, among others. A massively multiplayer online role-playing
                game based on the property is in development.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="p">Regularly cited as the world's largest esport, the game has an international competitive scene
                consisting of 12 leagues. These domestic leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World
                Championship. The 2019 event registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent
                viewership of 44 million during the finals. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on
                livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, and on cable television sports channel ESPN.
