                <h3>This Custom Pokemon Porsche Honors All Things Bulbasaur</h3>
                <p class="centered-text">
                    There are fans of Pokemon, and then there are guys like Akira Nakai. If you haven't heard of this man,
                    then you will soon know just about everything you need to. After all, the car-loving Pokemon fan is
                    going viral for his most recent customization, and it has everything to do with Bulbasaur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over on Twitter, fans got a look at a project done by Nakai when photos of a recent customization went
                    live. The fan, who is a well-known car tuner, gave an old-school Porsche a face lift in the name of
                    Pokemon. And as you can see below, the car is one worthy of any Bulbasaur enthusiast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is, if they have got some cash to spend.
                </p>
                <img class="article-image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDZkEWQXYAISjFz?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="bulbasaur" width="300">
                <p>
                    As the pictures show, Nakai took an old top-down Porsche from years gone and gave it new life. You can
                    see the car has been given a shiny light green paint job that matches Bulbasaur's body perfectly.
                    Matched with some sleek tires, the Porsche has a black hood and dark detailing that leads into a giant
                    BULBASAUR decal on the car door. If you look close, you can also see decals of Bulbasaur are on the car
                    which put the finishing touches on this makeover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no details on who this Porsche customization was for or how much it cost. However, fans know
                    no part of this process came cheap. Even having Nakai work on the car proves the owner was a big spender
                    given how famous the tuner is. Nakai and his company RAUH Welt BEGRIFF is one of the most in-demand
                    tuners for older Porsche models in the world, so Bulbasaur got a true luxury treatment this with
                    high-price Pokemon makeover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what do you think about this impressive Pokemon piece? Let me know in the comments or hit me up on

                <h3>Attention All Squirtle Squad Members, You Can Preorder a Squirtle Funko Pop</h3>
                <p>
                    Throw on your best pair of sunglasses, it is time to join the Squirtle Squad. Funko Pop! finally
                    released their Squirtle vinyl for preorder. Who doesn’t want to own the cutest and, quite frankly, best
                    water-type Pokemon? The wide black eyes are a little disconcerting, but not demonic like that SpongeBob
                    Funko we wrote about earlier this summer.
                </p>
                <img class="article-image" src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/7/70/EP012.png" alt="squirtle" width="300">
                <p>
                    Thanks to Entertainment Weekly, we know this Squirtle is already a best-seller on Amazon, just one week
                    after his debut. The Funko is currently at the top of Amazon’s Best Sellers in Action Figures list
                    (along with a ton of other Funko Pop! vinyls).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can preorder the Funko Pop! Pokemon – Squirtle now and it will ship out around September 1, 2019.
                    And if you don’t already have them, Pikachu, Charmander, and Bulbasaur are already available from Funko
                    Pop! to round out Ash’s original squad (no disrespect to Caterpie and Pidgeotto).

                <h3>Pokémon GO Players Can Now Dress Up As Bulbasaur, Charmander And Squirtle</h3>
                <p>
                    Pokémon GO may well be full of Generation 5 monsters at the moment with the introduction of some of
                    Pokémon Black and White's finest, but these new cosmetic items are perfect for those who can't resist
                    the nostalgia of the original critters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Available to purchase within the game's store as we speak are these Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle
                    hoodies and backpacks. Each item costs 200 Pokécoins each, meaning you'll need to spend 400 if you want
                    the complete set. The hoodies do work rather nicely on their own though if you're limited on funds.
                </p>
                <img class="article-image" src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article5528956.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/charmandershould.jpg" alt="charmander" width="300">
                <p>
                    It was recently revealed that Pokémon GO just enjoyed its biggest month since 2016, generating a
                    whopping $176 million throughout the month of August. We imagine a fair few of these new clothing items
                    will sell, too, which definitely won't do the app any harm.
                </p>
